Join us for some tip and tricks!\n\nI bet you would never believe that a paladin deck full of divine shields could\nrival with the most any top tier deck in terms of tempo or being able to\ncontrol a board as effectively as possible. Not so. With this deck, not only\nwill you be able to have the nuttiest of curve but also be able to compete for\nglory. Now I do have to say This is not the most tryhard of decks BUT it works\ndecently well and is a ton of fun to play!\n\nThe point of this deck is to play your minions on curve and get the most of\nevery single divine shield that gets put into play. whether it is trough a\ngiant [ Blood Knight ](/cards/75-blood-knight) , [ Light's Sorrow\n](/cards/61833-lights-sorrow) or [ Bolvar, Fireblood ](/cards/61831-bolvar-\nfireblood) you will be looking forward to make sure your opponent has\ndifficulty clearing your minions while you slap them in the face for insane\ndamage.  \n  \nGuide Coming Soon!\n\n<del> ** _____________________________________________________________________\n___________________________________ ** </del>\n\nDon't forget to sub: [ https://www.youtube.com/user/CanadianRumPunch\n](https://www.youtube.com/user/CanadianRumPunch) for more decks like this one\nin the future!\n\nI hope you guys enjoy playing this deck as much as I did, and May the top\ndecks be in your favor.\n\n*THANKS A LOT FOR ALL THE SUPPORT !* \n\n  \n  \nFull Guide coming soon!\n\n",

        "markdown":"So after seeing both [ Galvanizer ](/cards/89891-galvanizer) and [ Mecha'thun\n](/cards/89877-mechathun) I quickly realized (as did many others) the immense\npotential of a Warlock Mecha'thun deck. Aditionally, all the combo pieces\nhappen to be even costed and your aim is to get rid of your deck quickly,\nwhich makes for osme very convenient [ Genn Greymane ](/cards/89336-genn-\ngreymane) shenanigans.\n\nThe combo is as obvious as it is simple. Once you have Mecha'thun in hand you\nplay both Galvanizers to mkae him cost 8. then you simply draw your entire\ndeck (easily, thanks to 1-cost Hero power) and you'll only need 10-mana and\nmore than 4 health to pull it off.\n\nMecha'thun + Bloodbloom + Cataclysm. Your hand is discarded, your board\ndestroyed, and your deck already gone. There is no reasonable way (outside of\n[ Counterspell ](/cards/531-counterspell) or a lucky [ Demonic Project\n](/cards/89825-demonic-project) ) to stop this combo. It's Exodia in its\npurest form.\n\nNow, an addition that I didn't see anyone considering is [ Keening Banshee\n](/cards/62954-keening-banshee) After getting all your combo pieces in hand\nyou can easily just play Banshee into both Galvanizers (+ any other 2-drop)\nand burn the rest of your deck fairly quickly, while immediately setting up to\nwin on the next turn.\n\nOut of all the possible ways to get Mecha'thun to work, this seems the most\nconsistent, especially considering that it's probably faster than most other\nOTK decks that may or may not pop up. Even Warlock has already proven itself\nas a powerful deck that can outtempo control decks and control aggro decks.\nThis deck just swaps tempo for complete annihilation (which is probably a lot\nmore effective I'd say)\n\nThis list isn't optimized by any means, I just threw in as many stall cards as\nI possibly could to maximize the potential against aggro since no control\ndeck, not even Shudderwock can actually beat this, given you optimize draw and\nremoval.\n\nThey might actually have to nerf this. It just feels wrong.\n\n** Updates: **\n\nUpdate 1: Removed one Banshee and added another Curse of Weakness. Banshee is\nsupposed to only help you rush your combo against other combo decks. Curse of\nweakness can be huge against board-heavy aggro decks and stall until you get\nhealing or boardclears (and help Doomsayer stick)\n\nUpdate 2: ** We made it to the frontpage boys, thanks for all the upvotes. I\nwill craft the deck immediately at release, play it excessively and keep\nupdating it if it proves to be any kind of viable. **\n\nUpdate 3: after testing the deck in the current meta (since the only cards\nfrom the new expansion are combo pieces). It's very hard to survive against\naggro decks. even with the large amount of board clears available (tapping\nreally does hurt the face after a while). I'm beginning to consider if maybe a\nmore control oriented build with Voidlords might be better, although it would\nseverly hurt it's potential against other combo decks since you don't draw\nnearly as fast\n\nUpdate 4: \"Won\" two games. One against Big Spell Mage, and one against Taunt\nDruid. Curse of Weakness proved to be exceptionally useful as a stalling tool.\nKeening Banshee didn't see any use since both times the last combo piece was\nat the bottom of the deck. this proves, however, that the win condition can\nwork quite easily against any other slow deck, even if you can't turbo the\ncombo.\n\nUpdate 5: \"Won\" another game. This time against Odd Elemental Mage (not a\nparticularly strong deck, I know). This time Keening Banshee was actually\nrelevant, even if only for 3 cards (which stil accelerated the combo by 3\nturns). I'm starting to think more and more that a [ Voidlord\n](/cards/76913-voidlord) \\+ [ Possessed Lackey ](/cards/76948-possessed-\nlackey) style deck would be better versus aggro. Banshee works well enough as\na last minute card dump that the upgraded Hero Power isn't absolutely\nnecessary. I was also thinking about [ Witchwood Piper ](/cards/89427\n-witchwood-piper) to fetch combo pieces earlier, but in the Even version there\nare too many 2-drops while in the Voidlord version it would conflict with\nLackey, since Piper is a demon now (probably the only time ever that\nconsistency change mattered).\n\n",

Going\nBIG on Deathrattle would require inclusion of bigger Deaththrattle threats\nlike [ Mechanical Whelp ](/cards/89852-mechanical-whelp) .\n\n>\n\n> I also considered [ Goblin Prank ](/cards/89937-goblin-prank) for a while\nbut I think that fits better in the afformentioned BIG Deathrattle focussed\nversion of the deck with cube’s, stalkers, play dead’s & big minions. I’ve\ntried to make this version board-control heavy where you want your goblin\nbombs to ‘stick’ a bit more to the board, where the 2 damage to the face is a\npunishment for clearing them. In that respect triggering our deathrattles is\nfine but we don’t want the [ Goblin Bomb ](/cards/89850-goblin-bomb) 's to die\nunnecessarily as we lose Magnetic/Mech synergy potential.\n\n>\n\n> In the same respect; I felt [ Void Ripper\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76973-void-ripper) would be a frustrating\ntop deck or mulligan in this deck, when it's really an end game OTK better\nsuited into the above mentioned BIG Deathrattle cube variant. Our [ Goblin\nBomb ](/cards/89850-goblin-bomb) Deathrattles will still ultimately get\ntriggered if we want, when we bolt any of our Magnetic Mech's onto our bombs,\nor when we drop a [ Defender of Argus ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/542\n-defender-of-argus) or [ Fungalmancer\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76991-fungalmancer) down inbetween them for\npushing minions or threatening face damage. The threat of that Deathrattle\ndamage is still there ... we just hold board control too alongside it. The\nsame goes for [ Abomination ](/cards/597-abomination) , [ Ticking Abomination\n](/cards/61811-ticking-abomination) & [ Mossy Horror ](/cards/89417-mossy-\nhorror) .\n\nThanks for reading, check out my other Boomsday Project deck;\n\n##  [ Galvanized Mecha'thun ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1145874\n-galvanized-mechathun)  \n[ ![](https://i.imgur.com/maqPjhL.png)\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1145874-galvanized-mechathun)\n\n##  [ Kangor's Buff Army ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1152492-kangors-\nbuff-army)  \n[ ![](https://i.imgur.com/Kbdw1R7.png)\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1152492-kangors-buff-army)\n\n",
