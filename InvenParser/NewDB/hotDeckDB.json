Not so. With this deck, not only\nwill you be able to have the nuttiest of curve but also be able to compete for\nglory. Now I do have to say This is not the most tryhard of decks BUT it works\ndecently well and is a ton of fun to play!\n\nThe point of this deck is to play your minions on curve and get the most of\nevery single divine shield that gets put into play. whether it is trough a\ngiant [ Blood Knight ](/cards/75-blood-knight) , [ Light's Sorrow\n](/cards/61833-lights-sorrow) or [ Bolvar, Fireblood ](/cards/61831-bolvar-\nfireblood) you will be looking forward to make sure your opponent has\ndifficulty clearing your minions while you slap them in the face for insane\ndamage.  \n  \nGuide Coming Soon!\n\n<del> ** _____________________________________________________________________\n___________________________________ ** </del>\n\nDon't forget to sub: [ https://www.youtube.com/user/CanadianRumPunch\n](https://www.youtube.com/user/CanadianRumPunch) for more decks like this one\nin the future!\n\nI hope you guys enjoy playing this deck as much as I did, and May the top\ndecks be in your favor.\n\n*THANKS A LOT FOR ALL THE SUPPORT !* \n\n  \n  \nFull Guide coming soon!\n\n",

Deathrattle Goblin Bombs\n\n> Using the new Goblin Bombs and Magnetic Mech synergies to create big boards\nthat threaten constant face Deathrattle damage and generation\n\n###  BOMB GENERATION:\n\nAlthough not great as a standalone minion, [ Goblin Bomb ](/cards/89850\n-goblin-bomb) becomes a real threat on wider boards due to a load of synergy\nwith other mechanics. The deck includes some great bomb generation tools like\n[ Whirliglider ](/cards/89919-whirliglider) , [ Explodinator\n](/cards/89910-explodinator) & [ Boommaster Flark ](/cards/89848-boommaster-\nflark) .\n\n_ ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/375/505/636681637466146814.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/127/636687449909280965.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/118/636687419176121308.png) _\n\n_ ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/375/507/636681641321375570.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/375/507/636681641321375570.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/375/507/636681641321375570.png) _\n\n###  BOMB DEATHRATTLE SYNERGY:\n\nGoblin Bomb starts to shine when the threats of combo's come into play, with\nit's Deathrattle triggering early thanks to [ Fireworks Tech ](/cards/89854\n-fireworks-tech) , [ Necromechanic ](/cards/89917-necromechanic) & [\nSpiritsinger Umbra ](/cards/55522-spiritsinger-umbra) .\n\n_ _ ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/375/533/636681924659219399.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/125/636687435025271665.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/335/205/55522.png)\n\n###  MAGNETISE BOMBS INTO THREATS:\n\n_ The new Magnetic mechanic allows you to turn your 0/2 [ Goblin Bomb\n](/cards/89850-goblin-bomb) s into real board threats and start to control the\nboard with Mechs like [ Spider Bomb ](/cards/89807-spider-bomb) , [ Wargear\n](/cards/89799-wargear) & [ Zilliax ](/cards/89803-zilliax) . [ Venomizer\n](/cards/89921-venomizer) will proove a great surprise posion clear too. _\n\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/374/999/636674477672530838.png)\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/374/990/636674457914409174.png)\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/375/3/636674500079731700.png)\n\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/129/636687452406803101.png)\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/104/636687401685753164.png)\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/105/636687402917414988.png)\n\n###  CONTROLLING THE BOARD:\n\n_ The old guard of [ Defender of Argus ](/cards/542-defender-of-argus) , [\nFungalmancer ](/cards/76991-fungalmancer) & [ Bonemare\n](/cards/61834-bonemare) further bolster the Goblin Bomb stats and allow for\nstronger board control. _\n\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/330/483/542.png) ![](https\n://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/356/223/76991.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/370/17/636591521684409521.png)\n\n###  VALUE TURN 1:\n\n_ The new [ Mecharoo ](/cards/89933-mecharoo) and [ Jo-E Bot\n](/cards/89948-jo-e-bot) proove great value on turn 1. They can be bolstered\nby a [ Skaterbot ](/cards/89897-skaterbot) or triggered with a [ Fireworks\nTech ](/cards/89854-fireworks-tech) turn 2 to provide a great alternative mech\nfor our magnetic synergy. _\n\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/141/636687466135059050.png)\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/185/636687761243459173.png)\n![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/105/636687402917414988.png)\n\n###  POWERFUL COMBOS:\n\n_ As an example; A Turn 10 [ Spiritsinger Umbra ](/cards/55522-spiritsinger-\numbra) & [ Explodinator ](/cards/89910-explodinator) , with a [ Bomb Toss\n](/cards/89913-bomb-toss) to a friendly board Goblin Bomb is 8 Face Damage and\na board full of threats! _\n\n_ ![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/335/205/55522.png) ![](https\n://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/118/636687419176121308.png) ![](https\n://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/375/507/636681641321375570.png) ![](https\n://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/157/636687497701949759.png) _\n\n> ##  TECH CHOICES & OMISSIONS\n\n>\n\n> ![](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/356/217/73325.png) ![](https\n://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/335/82/55505.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/339/667/58724.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/339/376/62891.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/145/636687470633909348.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/356/443/76973.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/330/492/597.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/339/470/61811.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/368/903/636590939483223053.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/299/636688324760617745.png) ![](https://media-\nhearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/376/347/636688325512373259.png)\n\n>\n\n> I've painstakingly omitted [ Deathstalker Rexxar ](/cards/58724\n-deathstalker-rexxar) as I think this deck is more on the aggro side. If it's\nstruggling late game he's the first port of call for inclusion.\n\n>\n\n> I've also omitted [ Terrorscale Stalker ](/cards/55505-terrorscale-stalker)\n, [ Play Dead ](/cards/62891-play-dead) and [ Carnivorous Cube ](/cards/73325\n-carnivorous-cube) , as the deathrattle value isn't great for the sake of\ndealing 2 extra damage face. I think building and controlling board around the\nthreat of the [ Goblin Bomb ](/cards/89850-goblin-bomb) 's is enough. Going\nBIG on Deathrattle would require inclusion of bigger Deaththrattle threats\nlike [ Mechanical Whelp ](/cards/89852-mechanical-whelp) .\n\n>\n\n> I also considered [ Goblin Prank ](/cards/89937-goblin-prank) for a while\nbut I think that fits better in the afformentioned BIG Deathrattle focussed\nversion of the deck with cube’s, stalkers, play dead’s & big minions. I’ve\ntried to make this version board-control heavy where you want your goblin\nbombs to ‘stick’ a bit more to the board, where the 2 damage to the face is a\npunishment for clearing them. In that respect triggering our deathrattles is\nfine but we don’t want the [ Goblin Bomb ](/cards/89850-goblin-bomb) 's to die\nunnecessarily as we lose Magnetic/Mech synergy potential.\n\n>\n\n> In the same respect; I felt [ Void Ripper\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76973-void-ripper) would be a frustrating\ntop deck or mulligan in this deck, when it's really an end game OTK better\nsuited into the above mentioned BIG Deathrattle cube variant. Our [ Goblin\nBomb ](/cards/89850-goblin-bomb) Deathrattles will still ultimately get\ntriggered if we want, when we bolt any of our Magnetic Mech's onto our bombs,\nor when we drop a [ Defender of Argus ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/542\n-defender-of-argus) or [ Fungalmancer\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76991-fungalmancer) down inbetween them for\npushing minions or threatening face damage. The threat of that Deathrattle\ndamage is still there ... we just hold board control too alongside it. The\nsame goes for [ Abomination ](/cards/597-abomination) , [ Ticking Abomination\n](/cards/61811-ticking-abomination) & [ Mossy Horror ](/cards/89417-mossy-\nhorror) .\n\nThanks for reading, check out my other Boomsday Project deck;\n\n##  [ Galvanized Mecha'thun ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1145874\n-galvanized-mechathun)  \n[ ![](https://i.imgur.com/maqPjhL.png)\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1145874-galvanized-mechathun)\n\n##  [ Kangor's Buff Army ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1152492-kangors-\nbuff-army)  \n[ ![](https://i.imgur.com/Kbdw1R7.png)\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1152492-kangors-buff-army)\n\n",
