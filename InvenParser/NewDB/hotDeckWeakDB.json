        "markdown":"Hey guys, new expansion is here, and that means a ton of new decks and ideas\nwill emerge soon! Everyone is going crazy about Druid and Warlock, but I would\nlike to start with a “combo” deck that I most excited about, mainly thanks to\nthe new legendary spell. Here is my take on Miracle Rogue with the Boomsday\nProject!\n\n[ ![General](https://image.ibb.co/b6aVZk/General.png)\n](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fimgbb.com%252f)\n\nI am sure everyone has already seen Miracle Rogue in some version or the\nother, so I will mostly focus on new cards and new combos that you can find in\nthe deck. Note that there is no [ Gadgetzan Auctioneer ](/cards/131-gadgetzan-\nauctioneer) in the deck which I always considered as the main part of that\nname, but he just doesn’t really make the cut anymore. Instead you act like an\naggro deck that really want board control, executing your little combos and\nvalue cards along the way. In the lategame, when you lose board control\nsomehow, you still have a ton of burst potential with [ Eviscerate\n](/cards/382-eviscerate) ** ** and [ Leeroy Jenkins ](/cards/674-leeroy-\njenkins) ** ** with [ Cold Blood ](/cards/92-cold-blood) .\n\n[ ![Guide](https://image.ibb.co/nty675/Guide.png)\n](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fimgbb.com%252f)\n\n** [ Fire Fly ](/cards/55466-fire-fly) ** and [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) ** ** are your go to cards in basically every matchup. [ Fal’dorel Strider ](/search?search=Fal%e2%80%99dorel+Strider) ** ** is also very good keep, especially if you already have one of those early game cards, as Strider on 4 crystals is part of your dream curve. \n\n** [ Backstab ](/cards/471-backstab) ** is amazing but you can’t just keep him without thinking. First make sure your opponent is actually trying to claim early board presence, and then snap keep it. \n\nLast card worth mentioning is [ Vilespine Slayer ](/cards/55490-vilespine-\nslayer) ** , ** which is a card that majority of people always mulligan, but\nyou should keep it in fast matchups where you really want it on turn5 or 6 for\nhuge tempo swings. I recommend sometimes keeping it when you already have\nearly game covered.\n\n[ ![Selection](https://image.ibb.co/h29US5/Selection.png)\n](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fimgbb.com%252f)\n\nSo let’s take a look on new aditions in the deck!\n\nCard thatt definitely deserves to take a close look on is [ Myra’s Unstable\nElement ](/search?search=Myra%e2%80%99s+Unstable+Element) ** , ** one of the\nhardest cards to evaluate before you actually get to play with it. One things\nis clear though. DO NOT PLAY THIS CARD ON TURN 2! Not even on turn 5 on that\nmatter.\n\nNow that we got this obvious warning out of the way, let’s see where does this\ncard really shine. I believe it’s best somewhere around the point of the game\nwhere you have +-10 cards left in the deck. You can play with your resources\nmuch more freely if you have ** Unstable Element ** ready, and then you just\ndraw the rest of your deck in one swingy turn and play those new cards. Don’t\nforget that you will get ALL the spiders you have ready from ** Striders ** ,\nwhich means pretty sizable board presence in the process. If played correctly,\nit will be much cheaper and much better [ Sprint ](/cards/90-sprint) , which\nis a card you actually still play in this deck.\n\nYou have no cards in the deck, so you start to fatigue now right? Not at all,\nthis is actually where another card from ** Boomsday ** comes into action. [\nLab Recruiter ](/cards/89823-lab-recruiter) ** ** will be amazing in this\ndeck, and here is why:\n\nA) Play [ Lab Recruiter ](/cards/89823-lab-recruiter) on ** Strider ** for\nextra value and then another [ Lab Recruiter ](/cards/89823-lab-recruiter) **\n** on [ Lab Recruiter ](/cards/89823-lab-recruiter) . Every extra [ Fal’dorel\nStrider ](/search?search=Fal%e2%80%99dorel+Strider) ** ** is insane with empty\nor near empty deck, and chaining ** Lab Recruiters ** together means you will\nnever take fatigue damage again.\n\nB) Play [ Lab Recruiter ](/cards/89823-lab-recruiter) ** ** on [ Lab Recruiter\n](/cards/89823-lab-recruiter) , play ** [ Elven Minstrel ](/cards/76946-elven-\nminstrel) ** , play freshly drawn [ Lab Recruiter ](/cards/89823-lab-\nrecruiter) on Elven Minstrel. Repeat basically every turn for infinite amount\nof 12/8 stats when your opponent manages to deal with all these small minions.\n\nC) Once you add [ Valeera the Hollow ](/cards/62876-valeera-the-hollow) ** **\nto the mix at any point, things get much easier and even crazier.\n\nAnother card that goes great with drawing a lot of cards and avoiding fatigue\nis [ Academic Espionage ](/cards/89859-academic-espionage) , which should give\nyou a ton of extra value that did not start in your deck and deliver it to you\nheavily underpriced. There will be a ton of 1 mana [ Ultimate Infestation\n](/cards/62879-ultimate-infestation) ** ** bad beat stories in the future,\nthat I am sure of. However, I am still not super sure about how good this card\nis, so I am going to kick it off with just one copy a see from there.\n\n[ ![Changes](https://image.ibb.co/h24Puk/Changes.png)\n](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fimgbb.com%252f)\n\nThere are 3 legendaries in the deck, and I would be really unhappy to play\nthis deck without [ Leeroy Jenkins ](/cards/674-leeroy-jenkins) ** ** (often\nyour win condition when the game is close) and [ Edwin Wancleef\n](/search?search=Edwin+Wancleef) , who is just gigantic in this deck,\nespecially if you play him during your [ Preparation ](/cards/364-preparation)\n** \\+ [ Myra’s Unstable Element\n](/search?search=Myra%e2%80%99s+Unstable+Element) ** turn. I can’t really tell\nyou what to play instead.\n\nHowever, you can just easily play this deck without [ Valeera the Hollow\n](/cards/62876-valeera-the-hollow) , which I just added for some extra combo\napproach, but was never too important in the deck and often I didn’t play her\nin the first place. I would really like to fit in extra [ Shadowstep\n](/cards/550-shadowstep) ** ** to the deck, so this would be an easy swap if\nyou are missing ** Valeera. **\n\nGood luck with the new expansion!\n\nCheers\n\n** StanCifka **\n\n** **\n\n",

He never really leaves to be\nhonest.\n\nBy utilizing a Big Priest shell, [ Zerek, Master Cloner ](/cards/89863-zerek-\nmaster-cloner) is able to show how much he cares about you by never leaving\nyour side.\n\n** How to Play **\n\nFor those of you who normally play Wild, you are probably already familiar\nwith Big Priest. For those who aren't, try your best to get to turn 6 through\nutilizing removal such as the Shadow Words and [ Spirit Lash ](/cards/58722\n-spirit-lash) . Once you get to turn 6, play [ Shadow Essence ](/cards/62896\n-shadow-essence) or [ Zerek, Master Cloner ](/cards/89863-zerek-master-cloner)\n(doesn't really matter if he dies, you can always get him back later).\nAfterwards, use all the revive effects to bring back Zerek or [ Obsidian\nStatue ](/cards/62870-obsidian-statue) and just overwhelm the opponent with\neither a swarm of 5/5s or 4/8 lifesteal taunts. If your swarm of undying 5/5s\naren't able to finish off your opponent, [ Shadowreaper Anduin ](/cards/62889\n-shadowreaper-anduin) is there to help not only clean up the board but then\nalso provide the last bit of damage with the help of all the cheap buffs.\n\nDon't worry about throwing away buffs on [ Obsidian Statue ](/cards/62870\n-obsidian-statue) or your [ Free From Amber ](/cards/55542-free-from-amber)\nminion because there is probably too much buffs and I should find a way to\nreduce that and get better early game.\n\n** Match ups **\n\nAs you can probably tell, this deck struggles against aggressive decks, not\nreally a surprise. That being said, this deck has a real easy time pulling\nwins out of it's ass after turn 6-7 so any slow deck is often an easy match up\nas they just can't deal with endless storm of Zereks and Obsidian Statue.\n\n** Mulligan Guide **\n\nSince I still don't really know what the defining archetypes for each deck is\n(and I don't think they are all decided yet, still day 2 of the expansion) so\nI'll just say what you want to mulligan for depending on the match up.\n\nFor aggro decks, try to find [ Shadow Word: Pain ](/cards/315-shadow-word-\npain) and [ Spirit Lash ](/cards/58722-spirit-lash) . These two cards are\neasily the safest ticket out of the early game.\n\nFor combo and control decks, pretty much hard mulligan for [ Zerek, Master\nCloner ](/cards/89863-zerek-master-cloner) or [ Shadow Essence ](/cards/62896\n-shadow-essence) . [ Shadow Visions ](/cards/55463-shadow-visions) are fine\ntoo since it lets you try finding said [ Shadow Essence ](/cards/62896-shadow-\nessence) .\n\n** Substitutes **\n\n[ Shadowreaper Anduin ](/cards/62889-shadowreaper-anduin) is mostly just icing\non an already late game powerhouse. If you don't have him and don't want to\nmake him, he can just be replaced by more removal such as [ Shadow Word: Death\n](/cards/547-shadow-word-death) . If silence becomes a big thing (which I\nstill don't think it will), [ Mass Dispel ](/cards/249-mass-dispel) could also\nbe a good replacement. Finally, if you want to be real greedy, [ Extra Arms\n](/cards/89912-extra-arms) is also pretty decent at being able to help keep\nZerek alive for longer.\n\n[ Vivid Nightmare ](/cards/89351-vivid-nightmare) is absurdly good in the\ndeck, but it's still replaceable. Another copy of [ Extra Arms ](/cards/89912\n-extra-arms) is good and [ Divine Spirit ](/cards/554-divine-spirit) is also\npretty decent.\n\n[ Obsidian Statue ](/cards/62870-obsidian-statue) is a card that is incredibly\nimportant just because it's strong in so many match ups, but if you don't have\nit, [ The Lich King ](/cards/62922-the-lich-king) , [ Deranged Doctor\n](/cards/89466-deranged-doctor) both do a decent job, albeit not as good of a\njob.\n\n[ Psychic Scream ](/cards/76911-psychic-scream) is pretty good for securing\nwins against aggro, but originally I had a second copy of [ Power Word Shield\n](/search?search=Power+Word+Shield) . This does not do the same job\nwhatsoever, but there isn't really another card that does what the scream\ndoes.\n\n[ Shadow Visions ](/cards/55463-shadow-visions) and [ Zerek, Master Cloner\n](/cards/89863-zerek-master-cloner) are the only two non-common and rare cards\nyou actually need for the deck. [ Shadow Visions ](/cards/55463-shadow-\nvisions) simply provides way too much consistency for the deck that is very\nmuch needed and [ Zerek, Master Cloner ](/cards/89863-zerek-master-cloner) is\nliterally the reason why this deck exists, so no cuts for either of them,\nsorry.\n\n** Final Verdict **\n\nHere's where I normally say how good a deck is and how I feel it compares\nagainst most the meta. However, the meta hasn't really stabilized yet so I'll\njust talk about how it feels at the current rank I'm at (played it from 15-9\nso far). The deck punishes the daylights out of control decks. To the point\nwhere I don't think I've actually lost a match to a control deck. As for combo\ndecks, it typically depends on how fast they are able to pop off.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for priest to really interact with these types\nof decks. The one way we can interact is by getting [ Nozdormu\n](/cards/285-nozdormu) off of [ Free From Amber ](/cards/55542-free-from-\namber) , which is not a reliable way to win at all. I've still beaten combo\ndecks by just rushing them down (and the aforementioned Nozdormu play), but it\nfeels like a mixed matchup. Aggro match ups are easily the worst but atleast\nfor me, I haven't been seeing that many aggressive ones. Odd Paladins are not\nthat bad if you can get [ Spirit Lash ](/cards/58722-spirit-lash) but Odd\nrogues are literally the worst thing for the deck. This deck just flat out\ncannot beat a turn 3 [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) because\nit becomes a 4/4 immediately, then by the first time we can properly deal with\nit, it has already dealt too much damage. That being said though, I still\nthink this deck is pretty decent. I've mostly gone against slower decks and\nthis deck excels at beating those. Not only that, but nobody knows how to deal\nwith [ Zerek, Master Cloner ](/cards/89863-zerek-master-cloner) and I find\nthat hysterical. Overall, I'd recommend this deck in a heartbeat. It is\nwithout a doubt the most fun I've had in this game for ages. With all the zoo\nand other aggressive decks running amok, this deck hasn't really been doing\nthat well unfortunately, so as of right now I'm working on making a deck that\nstill utilizes Zerek to the extremes, but is more board focused.\n\nSo I made a list that is more focused on the board and is a midrange deck, [\nhere's a link to it. ](http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1169355-dragon-master-\nzerek)\n\n",

        "markdown":"Just killed a warrior on turn 6 from 33 health with nothing but a [ Necrium\nBlade ](/cards/89872-necrium-blade) on board\n\nEdit: thanks for the upvotes. Here's a small description:\n\nThe deck's idea is to assemble the whole combo through a single [ Elven\nMinstrel ](/cards/76946-elven-minstrel) . That happens 100% of the time when\nyou do not play the [ Cavern Shinyfinder ](/cards/76984-cavern-shinyfinder) ,\nhowever i have found that card to add consistency rather than lower it.\n\nThe way you actually win is by having a 1 charge [ Necrium Blade\n](/cards/89872-necrium-blade) equipped, then playing [ Kobold Illusionist\n](/cards/73331-kobold-illusionist) -> attack > [ Backstab\n](/cards/471-backstab) (or [ Razorpetal ](/cards/55600-razorpetal) ) the\nIllusionist and then burn the opponent. That's 4 mana for 2 copies of [\nMalygos ](/cards/241-malygos) . [ Shadowstep ](/cards/550-shadowstep) s only\nhelp prepare a 2 mana Illusionist, leading to an even cheaper setup, that can\nallow us to burn even a high armor opponent. They are however not highly\nimportant and are probably the first cards to replace.\n\nCards like [ Bloodmage Thalnos ](/cards/525-bloodmage-thalnos) , [ Vilespine\nSlayer ](/cards/55490-vilespine-slayer) or some taunts would help keep us\nalive, but would lead to us needing more time and more draw. Personally, i\nhave not found that version of the deck as interesting or effective.\n\nEdit #2: i've replaced the two [ Shadowstep ](/cards/550-shadowstep) s for one\n[ Sudden Betrayal ](/cards/76865-sudden-betrayal) and one [ Necrium Vial\n](/cards/89879-necrium-vial) , as a test. The first is aimed at helping\nagainst aggro and  the  second against high armor decks (and slow draws).\n\nAs for  ** Mulligan ** choices: Always keep one [ Elven Minstrel\n](/cards/76946-elven-minstrel) , as he gets us the full combo. Mulligan\naggressively for him.\n\nIf you are certain the opponent is playing aggro, you can keep effective\nremoval like [ Backstab ](/cards/471-backstab) or [ Sap ](/cards/385-sap) . If\nyou are certain they are slow, keep [ Preparation ](/cards/364-preparation)\nand [ Razorpetal Volley ](/cards/55580-razorpetal-volley) , as they speed\nthings up for you.\n\nUpdate #3:\n\nI replaced the Shinyfinder with a second Sudden Betrayal, partially because\nthe secret was performing well, partially because of a rage moment on a\nshinyfinder topdeck on the wrong turn.\n\nI am personally getting close to a 50% winrate against zoo, which should be a\nvery bad matchup. Don't play like a typical control deck. When the pressure is\nnot too high, try to ignore it and setup your combo. You have to win first,\nnot outlast them.\n\nThank everyone for the enormous feedback. This is something i never expected.\nI hope you keep having fun!\n\n* * *\n\n** Final Edit: **\n\nI do not have the time to refine this deck as much as I would like. However as\nmany of you have found, tuning it is not too hard, because there are a few\nsimple guidelines to follow.\n\n1\\. You should be very careful about adding more minions. Every one reduces\nthe effectiveness of [ Elven Minstrel ](/cards/76946-elven-minstrel) by a lot,\nand that card is the soul of the deck.\n\n2\\. Mulligan almost everything for Elven Minstrel and go for the combo as soon\nas possible. If your opponent doesn't have lethal on board and you can set up\nthe OtK, go for it. Don't play this as control because the rogue class does\nnot have the tools for that.\n\n3\\. Don't give up if your opponent is gaining a lot of armour. If you find the\nright spells you can burn through obscene amounts of it, as demonstrated in\nthe videos.\n\nAnd an  ** important clarification ** . The deck has a somewhat weird approach\nto it. Contrary to what most players are used to, the aim is not to have a\nfair chance to win every game. Instead the deck aims at being extremely\nfavoured when drawing properly, while accepting that there will be a few games\nyou just concede. It is in a sense a coinflip deck, except the odds depend on\nthe metagame, rather than always being 50-50.\n\nHere's a video of the deck by Kiwiinbacon.  \n\nAnd here is the second video!\n\n  \n\n",

If you have the coin you should always keep/search for the [ SI:7 Agent ](/cards/286-si-7-agent) and you may also consider the idea of keeping a [ Giggling Inventor ](/cards/89838-giggling-inventor) . \n\n** VS CONTROL/COMBO ** : In this case the options really depend on the class and deck you are facing but I’d say that generally you’ll never go wrong if you keep [ Fire Fly ](/cards/55466-fire-fly) and [ Vicious Fledgling ](/cards/55584-vicious-fledgling) , if you are facing a passive class you may instead search for an [ Argent Squire ](/cards/473-argent-squire) \\+ [ Cold Blood ](/cards/92-cold-blood) as your opponent will have a hard time dealing with that (Ex. Big Spell Mage). If you have coin and you know your opponent plays annoying taunt minions always keep [ Vilespine Slayer ](/cards/55490-vilespine-slayer) and if your opponent has a very passive deck you may want to keep [ Edwin VanCleef ](/cards/3-edwin-vancleef) with your coin. \n\nThat’s it for the general guides, let’s now jump in the class specific guides!\n\n** VS Druid ** : As of right now there are 3 main Druid decks around, Malygos;Towaggle;Meca Thun. Those match ups are neither good or bad for you, It really depends on the draw that each player makes and how much damage can you push while securing your board. You’ll be surprised how easily they will be able to remove your single threats, that’s why you should mulligan for a [ Argent Squire ](/cards/473-argent-squire) and a [ Cold Blood ](/cards/92-cold-blood) to combo with, the only way they’ll have to remove this would be a [ Naturalize ](/cards/154-naturalize) (and that would be okay as you draw 2 cards) or a double removal on your single minion, you should also search for a [ Vicious Fledgling ](/cards/55584-vicious-fledgling) as if they aren’t instantly going to remove it they will be in serious troubles. \n\n** VS Hunter ** : We are now usually facing 3 type of hunters on the ladder, Deathrattle;Spell;Mech.I consider all of these match ups slightly favored, you generally want to keep a [ Dire Mole ](/cards/76996-dire-mole) or a [ Fire Fly ](/cards/55466-fire-fly) as these  will help your weapon to remove his early minions, as a 3 drop the best thing you can mulligan for is the [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) as it is the only minion that your enemy usually won't be able to remove at turn 3 by using his [ Eaglehorn Bow ](/cards/363-eaglehorn-bow) as It will go from being 3/3 to a 4/4. \n\n** VS Mage ** : Here things start getting a bit more complicated, as of right now we are mainly facing Big Spell Mages on the ladder but you'll also see some Aluneth Mage, this last one won't be a problem at all, just use the general mulligan for aggro decks. When speaking about Big Spell that's where things get a bit complicated, prepare yourself as you'll have quite a disadvantage, you have to push as much damage as you can before his turn 5, If you don't have coin just hard mulligan for an [ Argent Squire ](/cards/473-argent-squire) to combo with [ Cold Blood ](/cards/92-cold-blood) and a [ Vicious Fledgling ](/cards/55584-vicious-fledgling) , If you luckily happen to have coin also keep [ Ironbeak Owl ](/cards/500-ironbeak-owl) . \n\n** VS Paladin ** : We are mainly facing Odd Paladin of different kinds (mech,old odd ecc.), this is another situation where you have a disadvantage as he will have an easy time controlling the board. You want to hard mulligan for [ Dire Mole ](/cards/76996-dire-mole) and [ Fire Fly ](/cards/55466-fire-fly) as this will help you dealing with his hero power, also keep a [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) If you have It as It will be a powerful 3 drop. If you happen to have coin remember to keep [ SI:7 Agent ](/cards/286-si-7-agent) !! \n\n** VS Priest ** : We are now facing 2/3 priest decks, Mecha'Thun;Quest;Topsy Turvy OTK. Quest and Topsy are favored while you'll have a Disadvantage playing against Mecha'Thun, for the first two decks you'll want to mulligan for [ Argent Squire ](/cards/473-argent-squire) \\+ [ Cold Blood ](/cards/92-cold-blood) as It those are more passive decks and won't be able to easily remove this buffed minion and [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) because on turn 4 they will usually play [ Duskbreaker ](/cards/76868-duskbreaker) so if you play any other 3 drop on turn 3 It will just get removed effectively. Mecha'Thun on the other hand is a deck I've found quite hard to beat, you'll want to do hard mulligan for [ Dire Mole ](/cards/76996-dire-mole) \\+ [ Cold Blood ](/cards/92-cold-blood) (that's because they would easily remove the [ Argent Squire ](/cards/473-argent-squire) with their [ Wild Pyromancer ](/cards/25-wild-pyromancer) ) and a [ Vicious Fledgling ](/cards/55584-vicious-fledgling) as this deck does not play [ Duskbreaker ](/cards/76868-duskbreaker) . \n\n** VS Rogue ** : Rouge is also having 3 main decks played, Odd;Malygos;Deathrattle. Mirror match up is all based on who goes first and how good can you remove your opponent board and at the same time keep yours, that's why in this case you want to keep 1 copy of [ Deadly Poison ](/cards/87-deadly-poison) in your hand, you'll also want to search for [ Dire Mole ](/cards/76996-dire-mole) and [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) . If you have coin keep an [ SI:7 Agent ](/cards/286-si-7-agent) and you also may want to keep a [ Giggling Inventor ](/cards/89838-giggling-inventor) only if you already have a good curved hand so that you can use It to protect you other minions. Deathrattle and Malygos rogues are favored match ups, mulligan for [ Dire Mole ](/cards/76996-dire-mole) \\+ [ Cold Blood ](/cards/92-cold-blood) and as they will use their removal to delete this also keep a [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) as It will be a very powerful drop on turn 3. \n\n** VS Shaman ** : This is another complicated match up, you'll usually be facing Shudderwock; Even. You'll have a slight disadvantage against both of those as they will be controlling your board very hard. Hard mulligan for [ Fire Fly ](/cards/55466-fire-fly) and either [ Vicious Fledgling ](/cards/55584-vicious-fledgling) or [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) , they are nice 3 drops but will usually get silenced/removed as soon as you play them so It doesn't really matter which one you choose. If you happen to have coin keep [ Edwin VanCleef ](/cards/3-edwin-vancleef) to coin him on turn 2 and bait their [ Hex ](/cards/270-hex) on their turn 4. \n\n** VS Warlock ** : Here you may have the game you have always dreamt about aswell as your worst nightmare. You'll be mainly facing Zoo;Even;Cube. Generally hard mulligan for [ Dire Mole ](/cards/76996-dire-mole) and [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) as those cards will be very nice against all of those decks. Zoo is a favored match up, Even and Cube are terrible match ups for you, you'll have to search for [ Dire Mole ](/cards/76996-dire-mole) and either [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) or [ Vicious Fledgling ](/cards/55584-vicious-fledgling) hoping they are not going to remove them. \n\n** VS Warrior ** : Warrior isn't already defined but I've faced some Mech Rush;Recruit;Odd;Quest. The match ups where you'll have a slight advantage are Mech Rush and Recruit, where you'll just have to mulligan for [ Dire Mole ](/cards/76996-dire-mole) and [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) and you'll usually be ready to win the game, on the other hand I've found many problems facing Quest warr as you'll nearly never hit his face (just use the same mulligan of Mech Rush and Recruit) and I've always just conceded at turn 1 whenever i met an odd warrior because it's pratically impossible to beat.If you have coin always keep [ Edwin VanCleef ](/cards/3-edwin-vancleef) as it will be a really powerful turn 2 drop against all of these match ups! \n\nThat's It for the mulligan guide, sorry If I've been too specific or long but\nI've done my best!\n\nReally hope it will be useful to some of you!\n\n<del> 25 Upvotes and I'll be uploading the mulligan guide! </del> <<<<\nREACHED!\n\n<del> 50 Upvotes and I'll be uploading a full guide to the deck! </del> <<<<\nREACHED!\n\nUPDATE 1: Thanks for the advice Tommy Wave! I now have swapped [ Tar Creeper\n](/cards/55456-tar-creeper) for an [ Ironbeak Owl ](/cards/500-ironbeak-owl)\nin order to be able to push through taunts more easily! He made a video about\nmy deck, if you want to you can check it out in the comments!\n\nUPDATE 2 : I am now testing -1 [ Giggling Inventor ](/cards/89838-giggling-\ninventor) +1 [ Myra's Unstable Element ](/cards/89802-myras-unstable-element)\nas I am facing a damn of a lot of control and late combo decks.

Anyway thank you\nguys for the 20 upvotes and the fantastic comments! We're close to the 25\nneeded for the mulligan guide, It is work in progress right now so when we'll\nget to 25 upvotes I'll upload it as soon as possible!\n\nUPDATE 3 : Thank you all for the 25+ upvotes!

Climbed from rank 5 to Legend with this decklist easily. **\n\n** [ Dr. Boom, Mad Genius ](/cards/89827-dr-boom-mad-genius) is carrying games solo btw. **\n\n* * *\n\n** Card  ** ** Replacements: **\n\n\\- [ Reckless Flurry ](/cards/76945-reckless-flurry) only if you are  _ ** not\nfacing ** _ _ aggro _ \\+ any _ \"late game value\" _ card like [ Marin the Fox\n](/cards/73318-marin-the-fox) , [ Ysera ](/cards/495-ysera) , [ Elise the\nTrailblazer ](/cards/55451-elise-the-trailblazer) or even [ Direhorn Hatchling\n](/cards/55524-direhorn-hatchling) .\n\nIf you are facing _ aggro _ too much   - [ Dead Man's Hand ](/cards/62842\n-dead-mans-hand) \\+ any _ \"anti-aggro\" _ tool.\n\n[ The Lich King ](/cards/62922-the-lich-king) and [ Alexstrasza\n](/cards/303-alexstrasza) can be replaced like [ Reckless Flurry\n](/cards/76945-reckless-flurry) .\n\n[ Dr. Boom, Mad Genius ](/cards/89827-dr-boom-mad-genius) is ** MUSTHAVE **\nhere.\n\n* * *\n\n** 12.08.18 ** So now i hit ** Legend ** with it. ** I had only 3 or 4 losses ** . And, honestly, now i don't think you can replace any card, because all of them are doing their job well in every game. [ The Lich King ](/cards/62922-the-lich-king) won me 3 or 4 games solo (i stole Maly, Togwaggle, Mech'thun and maybe   something  else). [ Alexstrasza ](/cards/303-alexstrasza) won me 2 fatigue games that i was going to lose. \n\n![CW Returns](https://i.imgur.com/iyNLRjq.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n◻ ** 30 UPVOTES - Mulligan Guide  **\n\n* * *\n\n** Shuffle Recommendations:  **\n\nAgainst every class shuffle atleast one Shield Block/Slam/Acolyte to be able\nto cycle your deck (if you need to).\n\nAgainst Big Spell Mage (it's 90/10 for us) - try to shuffle your executes and\nbrawl, because many mages are playing with Geist, so you can spend your shield\nslams in early/mid game.\n\nAgainst Maly Druid (80/20) - The Lich King (or death grip if you got it),\nShield Blocks, Weapon Project, Dr. Boom, drywhisker armorer.\n\nOdd Paladin (80/20) - It's no need of this.  But you can shuffle warpath,\nbrawl, Flurry, bloodrathor.\n\nZoo Lock (60/40) - i don't think you will be able to shuffle anything...\n\nShudderwock (with lifedrinker)/Ch'tun deck (10/90)- lich king or deathgrip if\nyou got it.\n\nTempo Shudderwock (90/10) - all aoe spells you have.\n\nOdd Rogue (60/40) - you will not see any \"free turn\" here...\n\nEven Warlock (70/30) - Shield Slam, Execute, Brawl, mb even Flurry.\n\n** Deck Showcase Video made by Kiwiinbacon:  **\n\nXD Oh, i can't add it on phone :b  I will do this from computer soon. But i\ncan write a link here :\n\n[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CMqxw_YvtM&amp;feature=youtu.be\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CMqxw_YvtM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n",
