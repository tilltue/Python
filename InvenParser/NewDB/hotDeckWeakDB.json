Af  ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1133502-the-\nheal-zoolock) ter some play (over 250 games) i achieved ** LEGEND ** and faced\nall kind of decks, cant bring you guys a Winrate because i was playing without\na deck tracker, but achieved an solid ** 76% ** starting at 0 stars on Rank 2.\nHope you guys enjoy the guide, sorry if have some misspelling!\n\n** [ LEGEND PROOF ](https://twitter.com/FelipBasso/status/1023390357378215936) **\n\nThere are a lot of Zoolocks lists, but this one im playing was the solid one i\ngot so far, here are some tips, such as mulligan guide, strats against\nspecifics match-ups, etc.\n\n** Mulligan ** : Personally i like to keep max 1x [ Happy Ghoul ](/cards/62902-happy-ghoul) , and throw away everything that cost more than 1 mana, just keeping [ Soulfire ](/cards/529-soulfire) against rogues (good against [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) . \n\n** Match-ups ** :   \nWarrior  : Pretty usual, there aren't a lot of warriors on queue, most of them\nare Control archetypes, when playing against them, just keep agression, be\ncareful on turn 5 for [ Brawl ](/cards/297-brawl) , don't be afraid to silence\na taunt minion to push damage face.\n\nShaman  : This match-up sucks, and you will face a lot of Shudderwack Shamans\non queue. To win against them, you will need some luck, the biggest issues are\n[ Volcano ](/cards/52581-volcano) and [ Hagatha the Witch ](/cards/89355\n-hagatha-the-witch) . If you get lucky enough, they wont draw either cards an\nyou will win rushing face damage. You probably should kill their [ Mana Tide\nTotem ](/cards/613-mana-tide-totem) and [ Acolyte of Pain ](/cards/428\n-acolyte-of-pain) , denying card draw.  \nYou can also see some Even Shaman decks, in this match-up, just keep control\nof the board and you will win, they dont run board clears, only Hagatha, so be\ncareful turn 8.\n\nRogue  : In the mulligan, try to keep 1x [ Soulfire ](/cards/529-soulfire) to\nclear their [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug) . Just keep\ncontrol of the board, thats not a Face Race, so keep control, play with your [\nFungalmancer ](/cards/76991-fungalmancer) and be aware of your Leeroy+Soulfire\ncombo to end the game!\n\nPaladin  : You probably will only see Odd Paladins decks, and that's a easy\nmatch-up. Just keepÂ [card]Despicable Dreadlord  [/card] in the mulligan and\nplay the control game, if you drop the Dreadlord at turn 5 you basically\ninsta-win. Play around [ Level Up! ](/cards/76867-level-up) and randomly\ngenerated [ Sunkeeper Tarim ](/cards/55462-sunkeeper-tarim) .\n\nHunter  : Pretty easy match-up, just keep the board, be careful against their\nsecrets, your strongest enemy are [ Deathstalker Rexxar ](/cards/58724\n-deathstalker-rexxar) . Against egg hunter, you may think about trading into\ntheir first egg to not getting snowball'ed.\n\nDruid  : The easiest match-up between all, against Token things may get\nharder, your main enemy are [ Spreading Plague ](/cards/62841-spreading-\nplague) , you can play around that not floating the board with minions.\nAgainst Hydronox you only lose to [ Wild Growth ](/cards/282-wild-growth) into\nCoin + [ Nourish ](/cards/120-nourish) . In both match-ups, just keep hiting\nface and you will win.\n\nWarlock  : Against Even Warlock this deck sucks, but itsnt a impossible match-\nup, just play around [ Defile ](/cards/62840-defile) , try to not keep any 1\nhealth minion on the board, also play around [ Hellfire ](/cards/122-hellfire)\nand use your silence to pass through [ Hooked Reaver ](/cards/77010-hooked-\nreaver) . In the mirror, just control the board, be careful to not heal and\nbuff your oponent [ Lightwarden ](/cards/436-lightwarden) , If you face a\nCubelock, just rush them since they dont have many taunts beside [ Voidlord\n](/cards/76913-voidlord) .\n\nMage  : Against tempo its pretty easy, keep control, play around [ Explosive\nRunes ](/cards/76906-explosive-runes) and you will be fine. Against Big Spell\nthings got harder, at turn 5 they will have [ Dragon's Fury ](/cards/76963\n-dragons-fury) to clear you whole board, then [ Blizzard\n](/cards/276-blizzard) and [ Flamestrike ](/cards/44-flamestrike) , so you\nwill need luck to dodge all these clears. Against Elemental Mage you will need\nto win before turn 9 when they play [ Frost Lich Jaina ](/cards/61810-frost-\nlich-jaina) and got a ton of lifesteal.\n\nPriest  : Just play around [ Duskbreaker ](/cards/76868-duskbreaker) and [\nPsychic Scream ](/cards/76911-psychic-scream) and you probably win the game.\n\n",

        "markdown":"So before I start if this could get upvotes on this guide so it becomes more\npopular that would be great. That way more people see it, more people ask more\nin-depth questions, I answer the questions and add them to my guide for an\neven better guide as a whole.\n\nALSO THIS DECK IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE I MADE THE VIDEO GUIDE WITH.\nTHIS ONE RUNES DEMONFIRES, A SHROOM BREWER, AND AN EXTRA SPELLBREAKER INSTEAD\nOF 2 DIRE WOLVES, A LIFEDRINKER, AND A SARONITE CHAIN GANG.\n\n** Overview: ** This deck is a budget version of the Heal Zoolock deck that runs Prince Kaleseth and Leeroy Jenkins. It is more consistent than the deck that runs these 2 cards because of its lack of drawbacks and the fact that it has a strong turn 2 play (Homunculus vs aggro and Dire Wolf to deal with turn 2 Doomsayer). It has a surprisingly decent time against a lot of decks (I will get into matchups later) and I have to say other than the Face Hunter deck that I made this one is the next best option. That being said, that means you have to know how to play around board-wipes and I have been caught sleeping many times by accidentally playing into Defiles and other board-wipes which is why my winrate with this deck is only 56%. It is a standard aggro deck but has a lot of fuel and a combo that can potentially give you a huge board advantage in only a couple of turns. \n\n** Card Choice: ** These are potential upgrades you can make to the deck better as well as why I played cards that I did. \n\n** Cards I Put in:  **\n\n[ Reckless Rocketeer ](/cards/560-reckless-rocketeer) : This is the\nreplacement for Leeroy. It is in some ways better due to the fact that it can\nbe used as removal more effectively and if needed can just be a turn 6 play\nbecause it doesn't summon the 2 1/1's the for opponent.\n\n[ Demonfire ](/cards/452-demonfire) : This is used to buff the minions on the\nboard so they are out of kill range of removal OR to kill some sticky minions\nsuch as the Mage's [ Arcane Artificer ](/cards/76908-arcane-artificer) .\n\n[ Shroom Brewer ](/cards/77020-shroom-brewer) : This is a card I have tested a\nlittle bit with as a replacement for a lifedrinker because its added health\nmeans it can survive a lot of removal and it has an extra attack so it can\npotentially trade better as well. It doesn't do the direct damage which can\nsometimes be helpful to win, but its added stats means it can potentially do\nmore and heal a minion if needed to get another favorable trade rather than\nyour face.\n\n** Cards you can put in:  **\n\n[ Prince Keleseth ](/cards/58723-prince-keleseth) : This card makes the deck\nless consistent but snowball a LOT harder. If you put this card in and take\nout the other 2 drops I would recommend another Saronite Chain Gang and 2 Tar\nCreepers because the value they give is insane.\n\n[ Leeroy Jenkins ](/cards/674-leeroy-jenkins) : Replaces the Reckless\nRocketeer and is helpful because it is cheaper and can push for 1 more damage.\n\n[ Doomguard ](/cards/507-doomguard) : This can also go in for the Reckless\nRocketeer and is a sticky body that does a LOT of work. Some decks even take\nout a card and run this allong with the Rocketeer so if you take out something\nlike another lifedrinker it may improve the deck.\n\nNote: The cards that I run 1 copy of are the cards that I find are decent in\nthe deck but can be tinkered with in order to find the optimal deck. I have\nfound that Lifedrinker isn't as strong as I would like it to be, but is still\nuseful cause it can a last couple points of damage to get over a taunt heavy\ndeck and win. The Saronite Chain Gang combos well with the Funglemancer and\ncan be a good 4 drop, but against the matchups you are weak against they are\neasily removed by board-wipe that say a Shroom Brewer wouldn't be killed by.\nLastly, if you wanna run 1 less silence and tech in something else for the\ndecks you are playing against that is fine too I usually only need 1 but\nsometimes haveing the second one is useful.\n\n** Matchups: **\n\n** Bad: **\n\n** Shaman: ** Mulligan: Keep a similar hand to druid except you can prioritize the ** ** Librarian ** ** and other 1 drops a bit more to bait out removal for later plays and deal with the wide Even Shaman board. ** ** ** Even is a fine matchup because it lacks board wipe and you can win early battles by going wide fast. However, Shudderwock is different. All the boardwipe on this is insane and you have to play around it a turn earlier than most other decks. Don't commit to a happy ghoul combo on turn 3 because it can be wiped that turn wait till the next turn because they will have no response due to overload. Note, don't forget about Hagatha on turn 8, I lost this matchup 2 times because I forgot that she is played in this deck and I thought I was safe on turn 8... The Turn after removal is generally safe for a push due to overload and pray for them to low-roll the Lightning Storm when they play it. **\n\n** Mage:Â Mulligan: Just keep for aggro and pray in this one, I am like 1/6 against it it is a really bad matchup. ** ** In this matchup you go as aggro as possible and hope they don't have Dragon's Fury on turn 5. Basically if they do you lose the game and if they don't you may be able to push into a potential lethal situation. in this matchup you keep the demonfire because the mage removal does more damage than you can pump the minions and it can deal with the Artificer.  Mulligan:  Just keep for aggro and pray in this one, I am like 1/6 against it it is a really bad matchup. **\n\n** ** Warrior: ** ** ** Mulligan: Prioritize Demons to pump up and the Humonculus in order to protect your other minions against the Blood Razor. ** ** This matchup is similar to the Mage one except do to the removal being a little weaker but the taunts and stalls being the issue you have a little more wiggle room. In this one you wanna play the funglemancer on 5 if possible to keep things out of kill range as well as use demonfire on a demon. This can bait out executes and harder removal which means you can flood the board easier. The Humonculus is huge because it can stay in front of the Blood Razer weapon and keep your 3 health minions safe.  **\n\n** Hunter:Â Mulligan: Keep Voidwalker and Humonculus in order to test the secrets, obviously keep the Flame Imp too but I would play the voidwalker first to test the trap cause an explosive trap could devastateÂ you if you play a flame imp too. Don't keep demonfire in this one cause a freezing trap could wreck you and it doesn't do enough damage to kill a 3/3 wolf or a 5/5 Dino that the hunter deck revolves around. This matchup is very close and since there are 3 different decks that all play a little differently I would recommend keeping a standard hand but playing a voidwalker as your 1-drop of choice to limit potential secret damage and to protect future minions from candleshot.  ** ** This one is decided by the secrets they play generally and they are hard to play around due to the fact that they are secrets... Don't use the librarian in this matchup early because often times a secret or the candleshot kills it. Other than that you can often go face and win and outpace them because the Hunter decks right now are kinda midrange with a little bit of removal which means you can show a little less fear with this matchup. The Egg matchup I have had difficulty with actually and I would just say kill the egg before they can get more than like 1 extra 5/5 out of it or just use a silence on it (This deck is one of the reasons I opted for 1 extra silence). **\n\n** Priest:  I haven't played against any priests in like 50 games so I am just speculating this matchup. Basically the Flame Imp kills the Cleric, pumping minions keep them out of range of a Duskbreaker, silence is useful in this matchup, and Psychic Scream isn't that bad because you draw so much and can regain a lot of the cards that were sent back to the deck.  **\n\n** Warlock:  Mulligans: Go for standard mulligans here and Librarian is nice here cause you can keep up in card draw with the Even matchup and trade into a Flame Imp for the Zoo matchup.  Often times the Even matchup goes to you if you can pump up your minions around hellfire and not play a 1,2,3 health minion into Defile. Control how many minions you play so you don't get blown out with removal and keep the opponent above 15 Health until you have a stable enough board to do a ton of damage because he plays a 7/7 taunt for 4. Silence is NUTS here in this matchup so if you draw it save it for a taunt or a really nice trade into a Twilight Drake. For Mirror, the matchup is more consistent for you, but if they get prince Keleseth they can snowball. Even if they get it you can get extra tempo with your turn 2 play and it can sometimes be enough to pull you into a winning position. Also, if they run him and can't play him that is a free turn 2 for you and you are a lot more likely to win. **\n\n** ** Druid:  Mulligan: Go for early game power (like Flame imp with a demonfire or a Humonculus) or a potential way to happy ghoul combo early.  You can also keep the Librarian if you are first because it can deal 1 and they Druid might take a couple turns to deal with it if they wild growth instead of hero power. ** ** All the Matchups play the same. You want to try to play around swipe with limited 1 health minions or pumping up the minions. Don't over commit to the board. Turn 5 you can Funglemancer to set up for a Spreading Plague play by limiting your board size with 1 minion on turn 5 and making your minions stronger to deal with the 1/5 Taunts. After that it is just Primordial Drake. ** **\n\n** Good:  **\n\n** ** Pally:Â Mulligan: Keep all taunts and the Despicable Dreadloard, you can draw into other options later after you gain control of the board. If you have a happy ghoul combo keep that too because it is a good value.  This one you have the best 2 drop taunt in the game and a Despicable Dreadlord for all the Silverhand Recruits and other 1/1 minions on turn 5 or even coin turn 4. Protect the Dreadloard and let it kill his minions and get a wide board in case the Stonehill Defender they sometimes run gets Tarim so you don't lose as much. Just play everything and makes some value trades with your taunts and go face with your more offensive minions to keep control of the board while doing a hefty sum of damage.  ** **\n\n** ** Rogue:Â Mulligan: Maybe keep a Soulfire to deal with his turn 3 play and keep taunts and other 1 drops to get tempo and make a wide board.  They have no way to deal with your wide board and you can Soulfire his turn 3 power play. Keep taunts so the weapon doesn't kill all you minions and after you pump them with Funglemancer you basically win the game. If you don't get taunts, just flooding the board is decent and going face because he can't kill all your small minions.  ** **\n\n** ** Last Tips:   \n** Soulfire can be used for more than just face damage, I get greedy and hold it for damage a lot, but it is useful against many classes with a turn 3 power play or a minion with 4 health that is in the way of 2 or your 3 attack minions.   \n  \n** ** If you have coin against Pally don't waste it, use it on turn 4 to kill his board of silverhands with a Dreadlord. **\n\n** **\n\n",

Play [ Mecha'thun ](/cards/89877-mechathun) and return this to your hand with [ Shadowstep ](/cards/550-shadowstep)\n  3. Play [ Voodoo Doll ](/cards/89404-voodoo-doll) and return this to your hand with [ Shadowstep ](/cards/550-shadowstep)\n  4.

Kill [ Voodoo Doll ](/cards/89404-voodoo-doll) with [ Backstab ](/cards/471-backstab) and win! :D \n\n** Tips: **\n\n  *     * You can replace the rest of the deck with other cards, but i think that a miracle Rogue [a Rogue that draws so many times] is the best choice. \n    * Do the combo in the explained order, because if you use [ Myra's Unstable Element ](/cards/89802-myras-unstable-element) with a not full/semi-full hand you are forced to play many other cards. \n    * You aren't forced to win with the combo: you can use also combo cards for a tempo play especially versus an aggro deck. \n\n** Fan's combo ideas: **\n\n** As I repeated many times, _ [ Assassinate ](/cards/568-assassinate) WON'T kill one of your minion!  _ **\n\n** [ Rvo2099 ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/members/Rvo2099) : **\n\n  1. Use [ Myra's Unstable Element ](/cards/89802-myras-unstable-element) with the same combo pieces in your hand. \n  2. Use [ Voodoo Doll ](/cards/89404-voodoo-doll) and [ Shadowstep ](/cards/550-shadowstep) it. \n  3. Play [ Mecha'thun ](/cards/89877-mechathun) and use a [ The Coin ](/cards/141-the-coin) [gained with [ WANTED! ](/cards/89363-wanted) ] \n  4.

Play [ Mecha'thun ](/cards/89877-mechathun) and [ Voodoo Doll ](/cards/89404-voodoo-doll) it. \n  5. [ Backstab ](/cards/471-backstab) [ Voodoo Doll ](/cards/89404-voodoo-doll) and win! :D \n\n** Edits: **\n\n  * Removed 2x [ Fal'dorei Strider ](/cards/76914-faldorei-strider) and added 2x [ Hench-Clan Thug ](/cards/89456-hench-clan-thug)\n\n_ ** I hope so much that you enjoyed this deck, leave an upvote and share this\nstrange deck with your friends! ** _ ** :D **\n\n",

EZ. \n\n###  Things to Consider\n\n  * ** When to Play Hemet: **   \nShort Answer, the turn right before you win the game. Long answer, when you\ncan guarantee a \"5-mana\" Mecha'thun (Any 3 point combination of coin's from [\nGilded Gargoyle ](/cards/77005-gilded-gargoyle) or Cost Reductions from [\nGalvanizer ](/cards/89891-galvanizer) ), A Reckless Experimenter in hand, and\nno other cards in hand except deathrattle minions.\n\n  * ** Early Game Deathrattle's:   \n** Since getting good draws off of Twilight's Call is so vital to the success of this deck, you might actually want to refrain from playing any early game deathrattles that AREN'T 2 mana draw cards. Not only that, but the more of those minions you hold onto, the more impactful your first reckless experimenter becomes. Treat this deck kind of like a Miracle deck, except instead of cheap spells you're stock piling cheap deathrattles. \n  * ** Beware of Big Boards: **   \nThere are A LOT of 1 mana 1/3's in this new expansion, and with them comes a\nwhole variety of \"new\" and \"innovative\" ways of jamming early game tempo and\nway too wide board states.Â We can't afford cards like [ Duskbreaker\n](/cards/76868-duskbreaker) as they slow our game plan down by forcing us to\ninclude big, hard to play dragons that could cost our our combo late game.\nHowever, some good early game tech options such as [ Crystalizer\n](/search?search=Crystalizer) might be decent options for keeping ourselves\nahead of the aggression that's likely going to be coming our way in the next\nfew months. And as always, ** NEVER ** underestimate the power of a well timed\n[ Silence ](/cards/544-silence) against the likes of Mech Paladin.\n\n###  Ideal Turn Break Down (Earliest Mecha'thun Win)\n\n  * Mulligan: Always look/keep for [ Dead Ringer ](/cards/89819-dead-ringer) , [ Loot Hoarder ](/cards/395-loot-hoarder) , [ Bloodmage Thalnos ](/cards/525-bloodmage-thalnos) and [ Twilight's Call ](/cards/76959-twilights-call)\n  * Turn 1: [ Awaken the Makers ](/cards/52588-awaken-the-makers)\n  * Turn 2: [ Loot Hoarder ](/cards/395-loot-hoarder) / [ Dead Ringer ](/cards/89819-dead-ringer)\n  * Turn 3: [ Gilded Gargoyle ](/cards/77005-gilded-gargoyle)\n  * Turn 4: [ Twilight's Call ](/cards/76959-twilights-call) \\+ [ Crystallizer ](/cards/89905-crystallizer)\n  * Turn 5: [ Reckless Experimenter ](/cards/89820-reckless-experimenter) \\+ [ Gilded Gargoyle ](/cards/77005-gilded-gargoyle) \\+ Additional Deathrattles \n  * Turn 6: [ Galvanizer ](/cards/89891-galvanizer) \\+ Coin + [ Amara, Warden of Hope ](/cards/52584-amara-warden-of-hope)\n  * Turn 7: [ Galvanizer ](/cards/89891-galvanizer) \\+ [ Hemet, Jungle Hunter ](/cards/55508-hemet-jungle-hunter)\n  * Turn 8: [ Reckless Experimenter ](/cards/89820-reckless-experimenter) \\+ Coin(x2) + Additional Deathrattles + [ Voodoo Doll ](/cards/89404-voodoo-doll) \\+ [ Mecha'thun ](/cards/89877-mechathun)   \n\n##  #THE_DREAM\n\n",

If it's\nstruggling late game he's the first port of call for inclusion.\n\n>\n\n> I've also omitted [ Terrorscale Stalker ](/cards/55505-terrorscale-stalker)\n, [ Play Dead ](/cards/62891-play-dead) and [ Carnivorous Cube ](/cards/73325\n-carnivorous-cube) , as the deathrattle value isn't great for the sake of\ndealing 2 extra damage face. I think building and controlling board around the\nthreat of the [ Goblin Bomb ](/cards/89850-goblin-bomb) 's is enough. Going\nBIG on Deathrattle would require inclusion of bigger Deaththrattle threats\nlike [ Mechanical Whelp ](/cards/89852-mechanical-whelp) .\n\n>\n\n> I also considered [ Goblin Prank ](/cards/89937-goblin-prank) for a while\nbut I think that fits better in the afformentioned BIG Deathrattle focussed\nversion of the deck with cubeâs, stalkers, play deadâs & big minions. Iâve\ntried to make this version board-control heavy where you want your goblin\nbombs to âstickâ a bit more to the board, where the 2 damage to the face is a\npunishment for clearing them. In that respect triggering our deathrattles is\nfine but we donât want the [ Goblin Bomb ](/cards/89850-goblin-bomb) 's to die\nunnecessarily as we lose Magnetic/Mech synergy potential.\n\n>\n\n> In the same respect; I felt [ Void Ripper\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76973-void-ripper) would be a frustrating\ntop deck or mulligan in this deck, when it's really an end game OTK better\nsuited into the above mentioned BIG Deathrattle cube variant. Our [ Goblin\nBomb ](/cards/89850-goblin-bomb) Deathrattles will still ultimately get\ntriggered if we want, when we bolt any of our Magnetic Mech's onto our bombs,\nor when we drop a [ Defender of Argus ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/542\n-defender-of-argus) or [ Fungalmancer\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76991-fungalmancer) down inbetween them for\npushing minions or threatening face damage. The threat of that Deathrattle\ndamage is still there ... we just hold board control too alongside it. The\nsame goes for [ Abomination ](/cards/597-abomination) , [ Ticking Abomination\n](/cards/61811-ticking-abomination) & [ Mossy Horror ](/cards/89417-mossy-\nhorror) .\n\nThanks for reading, check out my other Boomsday Project deck;\n\n##  [ Galvanized Mecha'thun ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1145874\n-galvanized-mechathun)  \n[ ![](https://i.imgur.com/maqPjhL.png)\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1145874-galvanized-mechathun)\n\n##  [ Kangor's Buff Army ](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1152492-kangors-\nbuff-army)  \n[ ![](https://i.imgur.com/Kbdw1R7.png)\n](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1152492-kangors-buff-army)\n\n",
